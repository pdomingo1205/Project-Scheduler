# Project-Scheduler

Project Plan
1. We need to calculate calendar schedules for project plans

2. Each project plan consists of tasks. Every task has a certain duration.

3. A task can depend on zero or more other tasks. If a task depends on some other tasks, it can only be started after these tasks are completed

4. So, for a set of tasks (with durations and dependencies), the solution for the challenge should generate a schedule, i.e. assign Start and End Dates for every task

5. It is ok to have a console app

6. The solution should be pushed to GitHub
